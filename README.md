# C Language Workshops - First Semester

Welcome to the **C Language Workshops** repository! This repository contains the code and materials for eight workshops that I completed during my first semester at Seneca Polytechnic. These workshops cover a range of topics from basic to advanced concepts in the C programming language.

## Workshop 1: Introduction to C
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- Basics of C programming
- Compiling and running a C program
- Connect and Transfer source code files to a remote host using an SFTP client application(WinSCP)

## Workshop 2: Data Types, Calculations and Expressions
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- Code a simple calculation using C operators and expressions
- Accept a numerical value from the user using scanf
- Cast a value from one data type to another
- Use integral data types to manage 2-digit precision points for a monetary application

## Workshop 3: Conditionals
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- Select appropriate types for storing program variables and constants
- Create meaningful variable identifiers contributing to easy to read and maintain code
- Code a simple calculation to solve a basic programming task
- Code relational and logical expressions to evaluate the true or false nature of various test statements
- Store user input values to program variables

## Workshop 4: Iterations
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- Code a decision using a selection construct
- Code repetitive logic using an iteration construct
- Nest a logical block within another logical block

## Workshop 5: Logic and control flow
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- to create a simple interactive program
- to code a decision using a selection construct
- to code repetitive logic using an iteration construct
- to nest a logical block within another logical block

## Workshop 6: Arrays
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- to store data of common/primitive type using an array structure
- to associate related data using parallel arrays
- to process the elements of an array using an iteration construct

## Workshop 7: Structures
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- to store data of different data types using a structure type
- to declare an object of structure type
- to access the members of an object of structure type

## Workshop 8: Modularity: Functions and Pointers
**Learning Outcomes:**:
- Create a modularized program using functions and multiple files
- Code functions to perform a specific task
- Call a function with several arguments of different types
- Pass an address to a function in a function call
- Refer to an address stored in a functionâ€™s parameter
