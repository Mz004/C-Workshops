Answer 1:
Yes, using multiple nested conditional statements(if-else) and iteration construct(loops) along with structure, it becomes easier to meet the requirement of this workshop. For example, In game play portion, i nested all if-else constructs inside while loop which will executed when condition satisfy to get desired output.


Answer 2:
Structure simplied our program by grouping variables together which might be more complex without structure.for example, if we want to store marks of 5 subjects of 5 students, we have to create 25 different variables if we do not use structure.
Example(without structure): 

int s1Sub1, s1Sub2,.....,s1Sub5;
...
...
...
int s5Sub1, s5Sub2....,s5Sub5;


However, with structure we can store it using only 10 variables.
Example(with structure):

struct StudentInfo{
int sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4, sub5;
};
main()
{
struct StudentInfo s1,s2,s3,s4,s5;
}
we can store using struct member : s1.sub1 or s3.sub5 etc.



Answer 3:
Level 3 is the deepest level of nesting used in my program which is stated below:
while (player.numOfLives >= 0 && game.movesAllowed >= 0)
{
    for (i = 0; i < game.pathLength; i++)
    {
        if (player.posHistory[i] == 1) 
        {
            if (game.bombLoc[i] == 1 && game.treasureLoc[i] == 1)
            {
            }
        }
    }
}
